# Data Analysis Project
This project is a tool for analysis of sound that was recorded in a physical space. This sound has reverberation and 
those reverberations can cause issues with speech regarding intelligibility. When a sound reverberates for too long it
can induce a reduction in how easy it is to comprehend someones words.

To begin the analysis process, press the load file button and select an audio file (.wav, .mp3, .m4a) from your files. 
The program will immediately will analyze any file it's given and returns a pop-up for the max resonance. Enjoy a slew
of graphs that are created for understanding how quickly a sound decays through a space. Please use these graphs a to 
their full extent and thank you for using our tool.
