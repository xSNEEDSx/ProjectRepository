# Data Analysis Project
This project is a tool for analyzing audio files to return numerical data on that audio. This data may be useful to you
for many different uses. Perhaps you are a student in a lecture hall and you have trouble understanding because their
words, you can use this tool to evaluate the decay of sound in that hall.

To begin the analysis process, press the load file button and select an audio file (.wav, .mp3, .m4a) from your files. 
The program will immediately will analyze any file it's given and returns a pop-up for the max resonance. Enjoy a slew
of graphs that are created for understanding how quickly a sound decays through a space. Please use these graphs a to 
their full extent and thank you for using our tool.
